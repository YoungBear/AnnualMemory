sia 2016

势不可挡



I'll smile I know what it takes to fool this town

I'll do it 'til the sun goes down and all through the night time

Oh yeah oh yeah I'll tell you what you wanna hear

leave my sunglasses on while I shed a tear

It's never the right time yeah yeah

I put my armor on show you how strong I am

I put my armor on I'll show you that I am

I'm unstoppable

I'm a Porsche with no brakes

I'm  invincible

Yeah I win every single game

I'm so powerful

I don't need batteries to play

I'm so confident I'm unstoppable to day

Unstoppable today unstoppable today

Unstoppable today I'm unstoppable today

I break down only alone I will cry out loud

You'll never see what's hiding out

Hiding out deep down yeah yeah

I know I've heard that to let your feelings show

Is the only way to make friendships grow

But I'm too afraid now yeah yeah

I put my armor on show you how strong I am

I put my armor on I'll show you that am

I'm unstoppable

I'm a Porsche with no brakes

I'm  invincible

Yeah I win every single game

I'm so powerful

I don't need batteries to play

I'm so confident I'm unstoppable to day

Unstoppable today unstoppable today

Unstoppable today I'm unstoppable today

Unstoppable today unstoppable today

Unstoppable today I'm unstoppable today

I put my armor on show you how strong I am

I put my armor on I'll show you that am

I'm unstoppable

I'm a Porsche with no brakes

I'm  invincible

Yeah I win every single game

I'm so powerful

I don't need batteries to play

I'm so confident I'm unstoppable to day

Unstoppable today unstoppable today

Unstoppable today I'm unstoppable today
