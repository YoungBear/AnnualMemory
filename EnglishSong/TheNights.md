Hey, once upon a younger year,

嘿，我们那时青春年少

When all our shadows disappeared

所有掩饰消失殆尽

The animals inside came out to play

内心狂野尽情释放

Hey, went face to face with all our fears

嘿，我们直面恐惧

Learned our lessons through the tears

从眼泪中汲取教训

Made memories we knew would never fade

深知那是永远无法消磨的记忆

One day my father he told me,

"Son, don't let it slip away.

孩子，别让这些时光泯灭

He took me in his arms, I heard him say,

他将我拥在怀中，我听到他说

"When you get older

当你长大了

Your wild heart will live for younger days

你狂野的内心会伴你度过这青春年华

Think of me if ever you're afraid."

如果你害怕就想想我说的话

He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind

他说，终有一天你会离开这个世界

So live a life you will remember."

那就去过你将永远铭记的生活吧

When thunder clouds start pouring down

Light a fire they can't put out

点燃无法熄灭的火焰

Carve your name into those shining starts

将你的名字刻进那些闪耀的繁星

He said, "Go venture far beyond these shores.

他说，离开海岸，去远方冒险吧

Don't forsake this life of yours.

永远不要放弃你的人生

I'll guide you home no matter where you are."

无论你身在何方我都会指引你回家的路
